<h3>Introduction</h3>

FcaStone (named in analogy to "Rosetta Stone")
is a command-line utility that converts between the file
formats of commonly-used FCA tools (such as 
<a href="http://tockit.sourceforge.net/">ToscanaJ</a>, 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/conexp">ConExp</a>,
<a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~galicia/">Galicia</a> and
Colibri) 
and between FCA formats and other graphics formats. The main purpose
of FcaStone is to improve the interoperability between FCA,
graph editing and vector graphics software.

<p>

FcaStone can

<ul>
<li> convert between commonly used FCA file formats (cxt, cex, csc,
slf, bin.xml, and csx).
<li> convert between FCA file formats and comma separated value (csv) files as
exported from and imported into databases and spreadsheets.
<li> convert formal contexts into the xfig format 
or into Bernhard Ganter's latex format.
<li> convert concept lattices into graph formats 
(dot, gxl, gml, ...) for use by graph editors
(<a href="http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html">yEd</a>,
<a href="http://www.jgraph.com/">jgraph</a>, ...) or
into vector graphics formats (fig, svg, ...) for use by vector graphics editors
(<a href="http://www.xfig.org/">Xfig</a>,
<a href="http://live.gnome.org/Dia">Dia</a>,
<a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>, ...).
<li> convert formal contexts into lattice diagrams (using
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz's</a> layout). 
<li> serve as a component of a server-side script for generating
lattices on webpages.
</ul>

<p>

Cautions:

<ul>
<li>
this software is in an alpha release state, i.e. for developer
testing. Not everything will work. <a href="#bugs">What to do
if you find a bug</a>.
<li>The emphasis of FcaStone is on converting file formats, not
on fast algorithms for lattice construction
which are already provided by other FCA software. FcaStone will take
several seconds to compute a lattice with 100 concepts. 
</ul>

These features are not yet available, but are planned for future releases:

<ul>
<li>Converting lattices between different formats in a manner that preserves the 
graph layout of the lattice. (This would also mean that other 
FCA software such as Galicia or Colibri could be called from FcaStone in
order to obtain layouts and efficiency.)
<li>Database connectivity.
<li>Convert into other knowledge representation formats (conceptual structures,
semantic web), if they are suitable for representing lattices.
</ul>

<h3>FcaStone and FcaFlint</h3>

The <a href="https://github.com/upriss/fcastone/">
FcaFlint</a> executable is bundled with FcaStone. FcaFlint implements
Relation Algebra operations for formal contexts. Both programs can
be installed and run independently. But if FcaFlint is used with
contexts other than "cxt" format, it needs
to be able to call FcaStone. In that case, the installation advice on
the FcaFlint website should be followed.

<h3>Downloading the software</h3>

Please, note that this program is distributed under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License v3</a>.
<p>
FcaStone can be 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=218988">
downloaded as a zip</a>
archive which contains the fcastone and fcaflint executable scripts,

<a name="installUnix">
<h3>Installation on Unix, Linux, Mac OS X</h3>

1) Note: FcaStone requires the Perl programming language to be installed. 
Perl is usually pre-installed in standard Linux and Mac OS X distributions. 
If Perl is not installed, it is available at 
<a href="http://www.perl.com/">http://www.perl.com/</a>. 
For some of the lattice conversion features, Graphviz is required (see 
<a href="#installGraphviz">below</a>).

<p>

2a) If you have administrator privileges, you should copy the file to a
shared bin directory (eg /usr/local/bin) and change the file
permission to executable:

<p><pre>
sudo mv fcastone /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/fcastone
</pre><p>

b) If you do not have administrator privileges, then you should move the
file to a bin directory that you have access to and that is in your
path (or create a bin directory under your home directory if it does not
already exist).

<p><pre>
mkdir ~/bin
mv fcastone ~/bin
chmod 755 ~/bin/fcastone
</pre><p>

If this bin directory is not in your path, then you need to add it to your
PATH variable (see <a href="http://kb.iu.edu/data/acar.html">here</a>
for further information on changing the Unix PATH variable).

<p>

3) If you are getting a "command not found" error right after installation, 
you'll need to run 
something like "rehash" or, alternatively, you could logout/login at
this point. Also, check the location of perl (for example by
typing "which perl"). Perl is expected to be installed in /usr/bin. 
If necessary, edit
the first line of the fcastone executable so that it contains the
correct location of your perl installation.

<a name="installWindows">
<h3>Installation on Windows</h3>

1) Note: FcaStone requires the Perl programming language to be installed. 
It is not difficult to install and run this software on a PC,
but Windows users may not be used to command-line programs.

<p>

Information about installing Perl can be found 
<a href="http://www.perl.com/download.csp#win32">here</a>.
I have tested installing <a href="http://www.activestate.com/downloads/">
ActivePerl</a>, which is freely available and can be downloaded as
an msi file. The default installation sets the PATH variable so
that it can find the Perl executable. 
<a href="http://www.c3scripts.com/tutorials/activeperl/">This
website</a> contains a short tutorial on installing ActivePerl
and on how to use the DOS prompt.

<p>

2) In order to avoid having to type long path names, it is probably
easiest to move the fcastone file into a directory which also
contains the FCA files that are to be used. The fcastone
file can be changed to executable format, or it can
be executed by preceding it with perl, i.e., "perl fcastone ...".
It might be useful to rename fcastone to fcastone.pl, so that 
Windows knows the filetype.

<a name="installGraphviz">
<h3>Linux, Mac OS X and Windows:
Installation of <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a></h3>

For some of the lattice conversions,
FcaStone requires AT&T's Graphviz program "dot" to be installed. 
Installation on Mac OS X, Windows and several Linux flavours is easy
because precompiled
versions of Graphviz are available and can be downloaded from the 
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz website</a>. (It is advisable
to install a recent version. Some package archives contain very old versions
of Graphviz, which run much slower.)

<p>

The table below shows which features require Graphviz and which don't.

<p>

Note for use on a webserver:
unfortunately, it may be impossible to install Graphviz on a webserver
on a commercially hosted account (unless you can find a statically compiled
version of the dot executable which can be copied to the webserver), because 
service providers 
don't usually give out administrator passwords. It should be possible, however,
to install Graphviz on a virtual private server  (because such accounts
come with administrator privileges).

<p>

FcaStone passes the data
straight to Graphviz. This means that only those output file formats are 
available which are supported by the local Graphviz installation.
If the labels in the lattice diagrams are not readable, then there is a problem
with Graphviz's ability to find the local fonts (see Graphviz's documentation).
If one of the formats does not work, try another (eg. gif instead of jpg).
The file fcaStoneDotErrors.log shows the errors and warnings produced by
Graphviz. The name of this file can be changed or it can be suppressed
by editing the line that starts with "my $errorslocation = " in fcastone.

<p>

If Graphviz is installed in a location that is not in the main Shell
path, it is useful to uncomment the line in fcastone that starts with 
"# $dotlocation = " and edit it to point to the location of dot.

Many tools for image conversion exist elsewhere. Depending on the 
local Graphviz installation, more options may be available
(eg. running "dot -Tdia -o outputfilename inputFileInDotFormat" on
Linux will produce output suitable for the 
<a href="http://live.gnome.org/Dia">Dia</a> program). Programs such as
ps2eps, fig2dev, ImageMagick's "convert", etc provide further options
for file conversions.

<a name="labels">
<h3>How to format the labels in the lattice diagrams</h3>

It is difficult to represent FCA lattices in non-FCA graph formats 
because concept lattices use up to two labels per node
(objects and attributes) which is unusual compared to other graph
applications. Since there is no graph format that is universally 
accepted as a standard by a variety of tools, it is furthermore
difficult to decide which graph formats to convert to.

<p>

The default in FcaStone is to concatenate the labels belonging
to the same node into one
string which is then cut off after 30 characters. If the -c option is
used, the  objects and attributes are "clarified", i.e., only at most one
object and attribute of each node is represented. The -t option
places the labels of each node on top of each other. This is only
useful if the output file is of type fig or svg and the file is
afterwards edited in a vector graphics editor. 

<p>

Two lattice designs are available (see some
<a href="https://upriss.github.io/fca/examples.html">examples</a>).
Using the -b option, each node is represented 
as a box. The objects are listed in the bottom half, the attributes in
the top half. The advantage of this format is that the labels never
overlap because Graphviz will adjust the box sizes depending on the
label sizes. The disadvantage is that this is not the standard FCA way
of representing lattices. The other design (which is default) is more
similar to traditional FCA lattices, with the disadvantage that labels
can overlap. The -t option only applies to the second design. 
These design choices are based on what can be stored in the dot format.
The gml output of FcaStone just places the labels across the nodes,
which is not satisfactory. Therefore, gml output should only be used
if the lattice is afterwards manually edited.

<p>

In general, automatically generated lattices will probably never be as
perfect as hand drawn ones. If perfect lattice  pictures are desired, 
then traditional FCA tools should be used.
FcaStone's facility for lattice generation is more aimed at
applications in which the lattices cannot be hand drawn (such
as automatically generated ones on webpages) and don't need to be
perfect (for example, because they are just used to provide a rough
sketch of what the lattice looks like).

NAME
<blockquote>
fcastone
</blockquote>

SYNOPSIS
<blockquote>
fcastone [-bBcgijmnNOprstuUw] <u>inputfile</u> <u>outputfile</u><br>
fcastone -l
</blockquote>


DESCRIPTION
<blockquote>
The program determines the type of the format conversion by looking at
the file extensions of the input and output files. If the files have
incorrect extensions or are not correctly formated with respect to how
FCA files with such extensions are usually formated, then the
conversion will not work. 
The input and output files can be provided as PATH names, but the 
PATHs cannot contain any dots. Basically, everything after
the first dot is considered the extension of the file.
<p>
At the moment only files which contain one (binary) formal context and/or one 
lattice diagram can be processed. 
<p>

<p>
The following options are available:

<table cellpadding = 10>
<col width="5%"><col width="95%">
<tr><td valign=top>-b <td> Box format: the nodes in the lattice are
displayed as boxes, which contain the objects and attributes.

<tr><td valign=top>-B <td> another Box format: the nodes in the lattice are
displayed as boxes, which contain the objects and attributes. Attributes
are separated by commas and the list of attributes is truncated if it is too long. 
Objects are separated by space and not truncated. This format is used by the -j option 
(where the objects are image files).

<tr><td valign=top>-c <td> Clarify: the lattice diagram is clarified,
which means that if more than one object or attribute belong to the 
same node, only one is printed. 

<tr><td valign=top>-g <td> Graphviz: the lattice layout will be calculated
with Graphviz (which means that Graphviz must be installed). 
It is not necessary to use -g with svg, jpg, gif, png, ps and pdf 
files because these imply using Graphviz. But for cex, csx, fig, and tex 
files using -g ensures that the lattice, not the context is generated 
(although this is only implemented for fig at the moment). 
In case of dot files, the -g option results in the coordinates being
included in the file.

<tr><td valign=top>-i <td> Imagemap: adds clickable links of the
format "script?attr=...+obj=..." to the nodes. This is only useful
on a webserver with svg files or html imagemaps. The script that 
responds to the request needs to be installed in the same directory
and must have the same name as the output file without extension. For example,
if a script calls "fcastone -w -i format.cxt answer.svg", then the
responding script must be called "answer". Because of the use of "-w",
no output file "answer.svg" is produced (see the examples
below). The "-i" option implies "-b", unless used with "-B".

<tr><td valign=top>-j <td> image files, such as Jpg, png, gif, etc:
instead of names of objects. It is advisable to use thumbnail-sized 
images. In svg output, clicking on a thumbnail will open the image 
in full size. The names of the image files should be provided 
as "path_to_thumbnail|path_to_fullimage" or as "path_to_thumbnail" (if
there is no full-sized image). Svg output files link to the images
but do not include them, therefore the paths to the files need to be
correct while FcaStone is running and while the svg files are viewed. 
For non-svg output formats it may be necessary to install extra Graphviz plugins.
The "-j" option implies "-B". 

<tr><td valign=top>-l <td> Licence: running "fcastone -l" without
any other arguments prints the licence and warranty disclaimer.

<tr><td valign=top>-m <td> Microsoft: prints the output file with Microsoft
style line breaks. This is only relevant for non-XML text files. 

<tr><td valign=top>-n <td> No input file: reads from STDIN instead of
a file. The command-line should contain something like "format.cxt"
instead of the name of the input file to indicate the type of the input data.
The "-n" option implies "-s".

<tr><td valign=top>-N <td> No output file: writes to STDOUT instead of a file.
The command-line should contain something like "format.cxt"
instead of the name of the output file to indicate the type of the output data.
The "-N" option implies "-s".

<tr><td valign=top>-O <td> One line input/output: this option is only
needed if FcaStone is called from a program using bidirectional
communication which can only send/receive one line at a time.
The internal linebreaks of non-XML files should be replaced with the 
character sequence '|%|%' for this purpose. For XML files, linebreaks
should simply be removed.
The "-O" option implies "-s".

<tr><td valign=top>-p <td> Pipe: only relevant for csv files. Use a pipe
(|) instead of a comma as delimiter. This option should be used if the
data contains commata. (Note: tab delimited files are provided by
the .tuples extension.)

<tr><td valign=top>-r <td> Rotating: only relevant for tex files.
Ensures that the attributes are rotated sideways in the formal context.

<tr><td valign=top>-s <td> Silent mode: suppresses warnings about output files being
overwritten if files with such names already exist.

<tr><td valign=top>-t <td> on Top: labels belonging to the same node
are printed on top of each other. This is only useful for fig and svg
files which are edited manually in a vector graphics editor. 

<tr><td valign=top>-u <td> Unicode: tells FcaStone explicitly that the
incoming data is in UTF-8 format. In most cases, this option will not
make a difference. This option should not be used together with "-U".

<tr><td valign=top>-U <td> Unicode: converts incoming UTF-8 data into
numeric character references. This option should be used if non-ASCII
characters do not display properly and the
output file is an XML file (html, svg, cex, csx, ...).
The input file should be in UTF-8 encoding.

<tr><td valign=top>-w <td> Web mode: this mode reads the input from STDIN,
writes the output to STDOUT and replaces "\n" with &#60;br&#62;.
In this manner, fcastone can be called
from a server-side script that generates a graphics file of a concept
lattice to be displayed on a webpage. See the examples below.
The "-w" option implies "-snN".

EXAMPLES
<blockquote>
fcastone waters.cxt waters.cex<br>
fcastone -g waters.cxt waters.fig<p>

Use on a website (Perl, explanation below):
<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
use CGI;
print "Content-type: image/gif\n\n";
$fcacontent = "object1,attr1\n object1,attr2\n";
open (PIPE, "| fcastone -w -b format.csv format.gif");
print PIPE $fcacontent;
close PIPE;
</pre>
Use on a website (PHP, explanation below):

<pre>
&#60;?php
header("Content-type: text/html");
$fcacontent = "object1,attr1\n object1,attr2\n";
$descriptorspec = array(0 => array("pipe", "r"),1 => array("pipe", "w") );
$process = proc_open('/usr/local/bin/fcastone -w -b format.csv format.cxt',$descriptors\
pec,$pipes);

if (is_resource($process)) {

fwrite($pipes[0],  "$fcacontent");
fclose($pipes[0]);
while (! feof($pipes[1])) {$retval .= fgets($pipes[1]);}
echo $retval;
fclose($pipes[1]);
$return_value = proc_close($process);
}
?>
</pre>


In these examples, format.csv and format.gif are just strings that indicate 
which formats are used for input and output; they are not filenames. 
The variable $fcacontent contains a context in csv format. SECURITY
WARNING: any form variables that are piped into a program must be
carefully checked for insecure data because otherwise a hacker
might be able to execute any command on the server. For further explanations
of this risk, do a websearch on "user submitted data" "security".

<h3>More details on using FcaStone with other tools</h3>

<p><b>Text formatting</b><p>

Latex is a document markup and preparation system.
The FCA latex output is to be used with 
<a href="http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~ganter/fca/">B. Ganter's fca.sty</a>.
Only contexts (not lattices) can currently be generated.


<p><b>Graph layout and editors</b><p>

<li><b>Graphviz:</b><br>

<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a>
is an open source (CPL licence) graph layout program with dot as its
native format. It provides a variety of file conversion options.
FcaStone calls it in order to produce the lattice layouts.
It comes with the XWindows program "dotty", which can be used to
edit the lattices (stored in dot format). A list of other tools that
can be used with dot files, is available on the Graphviz website.

<li><b>yEd:</b><br>

<a href="http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html">yEd</a> 
is a closed source, proprietary, but free to download, Java-based
graph editor with GraphML as its native format. It is easy to install
on Windows (exe file), Mac OS (dmg file) and Unix/Linux (sh file).
It can
import gml files. yEd has its own graph layout functionality. 
FcaStone can produce gml files without Graphviz being installed
(but see <a href="#labels">the comment</a> about the labels
in gml files).

<li><b>jGraph:</b><br>

<a href="http://www.jgraph.com/">jgraph</a>
is an open source, proprietary, but free to download, Java-based
graph editor. Presumably it can read gxl files, but I 
have not tested this.


<p><b>Vector graphics editors</b><p>

<li><b>Xfig/WinFig/jfig:</b><br>

<a href="http://www.xfig.org/">Xfig</a> is a Unix (Linux, Mac OS X) 
vector graphics editor with fig as its native format. For installation:
there is a tar.gz file on the website. On Mac OS, a binary can be installed
via <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">Fink</a>. On Linux, it should
be available through the usual package management systems.
<a href="http://www.schmidt-web-berlin.de/winfig/">WinFig</a> is a version 
that runs on PCs;
<a href="http://tams-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/applets/jfig/">jfig</a>
is platform independent.
<br>

Without the "-g" option, FcaStone produces a fig file of the context.
With the "-g" option, the lattice is produced.

<li><b>Inkscape:</b><br>

<a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>
is a an open-source, vector graphics editor with svg as its native format.
It can be downloaded and installed via sourceforge as binary versions
for Linux (package), Mac OS X (dmg), and Windows (exe).
Lattices in svg format can be uploaded into Inkscape. Inkscape has
a connector facility which would make it possible to edit graphs
so that moving a node also moves the connected edges. Unfortunately,
the connections are stored using special Inkscape-only xml tags, which
do not correspond to the svg files that are generated by Graphviz.

<li><b>Dia:</b><br>

<a href="http://live.gnome.org/Dia">Dia</a> is a GTK+ based diagram creation 
program for Linux, Unix and Windows released under the GPL license. It
is pre-installed on many Linux distributions. A Windows executable is
available. On other Unix and Mac OS X, it has to be installed from source.
Graphviz can convert dot files into dia files, if the required
libraries are installed (using
"dot -Tdia -o outputfilename inputFileInDotFormat").

<a name="faq">
<h3>Troubleshooting/FAQ</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>How can I represent Unicode (non-ASCII) characters?</b><br>
This depends on the local setting (operating system, fonts, etc).
If one of the output formats (pdf, svg, png, jpg, gif, ps) 
does not work, other formats should be tried.
Starting with version 0.2, FcaStone provides several options for using
UTF-8 encoded data:<br>
<ul>
<li> In some cases, no action is required. 
<li>If that fails, the "-u" option can be used to tell FcaStone explicitly that the
data is in UTF-8.
<li>If that fails, the "-U" option converts incoming UTF-8 data into numeric
character references. This will only work if the output file is an
XML file (html, svg, cex, csx, ...).
<li>It should be checked whether any programs that are used to view the
output files support UTF-8. 
<li>If the data is in some other encoding, it should be converted to
UTF-8 before using FcaStone. On Unix, this can be done with "iconv".
</ul>
More information on Unicode can be found on the
<a href="http://www.unicode.org">Unicode website</a>. 
<li><b>What kind of special characters are allowed in the names of
objects and attributes?</b><br>
That depends on the input and output formats that are used and if Graphviz is
involved. For csv files, if commas are within the data, the delimiter can be 
changed to the pipe symbol (|) via the -p option or to 
the tab character by using the .tuples extension. 
If Graphviz is involved, double quotes (") are not allowed in the data, unless the -B
option is used (in which case angle brackets (< >) might cause a problem).
The combination -> can also be a problem for Graphviz.
<li><b>Labels in the lattices are too small/misplaced or the
lattice is printed on two pages</b><br>
The lattices are produced by Graphviz, not FcaStone. These issues
depend on the local Graphviz installation. If one of the output
formats (jpg, gif, pdf, ps, svg) performs poorly, other formats should be tried.
<li><b>I am getting a "command not found" error</b><br>
See the <a href="#installUnix">installation information</a>.
<li><b>Nothing is happening at all</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Check the fcaStoneDotErrors.log file to see whether there are
problems with Graphviz. 
<li>Type "fcastone -l". If this does not print the licence, fcastone
is not executed at all. There must be something wrong with the installation.
</ul>
<li><b>It works from the command-line, but not as a script through the web</b><br>
Scripts on the web often run as a different user. 
<ul>
<li>Because FcaStone
writes a file "fcaStoneDotErrors.log", this file may need to be
manually created and write permission on this file given to others.
Versions 0.3 or later of FcaStone do not produce this file, if
FcaStone is invoked with options "-w" or "-N".<br>
<li>Also, it is possible that the script does not have "/usr/local/bin"
in its path. In this case, FcaStone should be invoked using "/usr/local/bin/fcastone".
</ul>
