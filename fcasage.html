<h4>Using FCA Software with Sage</h4>

The computer algebra software <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/">Sage</a>
is a free open source alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica and
Matlab. Hopefully, one day someone will write FCA tools that can be 
fully integrated with Sage. In the meantime, this website explains 
what can already be done with currently available technology.
(Further information on how to use Sage and FCA software
for teaching mathematics can be found in these
<a href="http://www.upriss.org.uk/maths/7106maths10.html">on-line
course</a> materials.)

<p>

Sage contains core modules and provides interfaces to packages which
can also be used individually. Because some of the functionality
exists both in the Sage core and the individual packages, the code needs
to be slightly changed depending on whether functions are used via
Sage or via an individual package.

<h4>Files used in the code examples/Preprocessing with FcaStone</h4>

The code below uses the formal context from 
<a href="https://upriss.github.io/fca/fcaintro.html#example">this example</a>.
The <a href="https://github.com/upriss/fcastone/">FcaStone</a> command-line
tool was used to convert between the different FCA file formats. For example, 
to convert from cxt to csv format:

<font color=blue><pre>
fcastone sageExample.cxt sageExample.csv
</pre></font>

The following files are used in the code examples below
(the "txt" extensions should be removed after saving the files):

<ul>
<li><a href="sageExample.cxt.txt">sageExample.cxt</a> 
<li><a href="sageExample.csv.txt">sageExample.csv</a>
<li><a href="sageExample.dot.txt">sageExample.dot</a> (the 
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> version of the lattice)
<li><a href="sageExampleMatrix.txt">the matrix of the context</a> which was produced by
converting the file to "slf" format and then manually deleting the
first part of the file up to and including "[relation]"
<li><a href="sageExampleLattice.csv.txt">sageExampleLattice.csv</a>
(the csv file of the lattice graph, produced from sageExample.dot
by the script described below)
</ul>

It is possible to call FcaStone via a system call from Sage. The
following example converts a cxt file into a slf file using FcaStone.
It then processes the slf file by deleting the first lines up to and
including "[relation]", splitting the lines into
arrays and finally creating a binary matrix of the relation in Sage:

<font color=blue><pre>
import subprocess
import string
from sage.all import *

pipe = subprocess.Popen("fcastone -N sageExample.cxt filename.slf", \
shell=True, bufsize=1,stdout=subprocess.PIPE).stdout
text = pipe.readlines()
pipe.close()

text= text[(text.index("[relation]\n") +1):]
for i in range(len(text)):
   text[i] = string.split(text[i])

M1 = Matrix(GF(2),text)
print M1
</pre></font>

<h4>NetworkX: Importing formal contexts as graphs</h4>

The <a href="http://networkx.lanl.gov/">NetworkX</a> tool (which is
part of Sage) provides numerous graph algorithms. The easiest way
to import a formal context into NetworkX is to use a csv file
which can be obtained as described in the <a href="#preprocessing">previous 
section</a>. Note: it is important not to have blank lines at the end
of the csv file.

This can now be imported into NetworkX as a graph as follows:

<font color=blue><pre>
from networkx import *
G = read_edgelist("sageExample.csv",delimiter=",")
</pre></font>

or into Sage:

<font color=blue><pre>
import networkx
from sage.all import *
G = networkx.read_edgelist("sageExample.csv",delimiter=",")
G2 = Graph(G)
</pre></font>

In this case G is a graph in the NetworkX format whereas G2 is the
same graph in Sage's format. G can use NetworkX functions (e.g.
<font color=blue>G.nodes()</font>), whereas G2 can use either
Sage functions (<font color=blue>G2.show()</font>) or 
NetworkX functions (<font color=blue>G2.networkx_graph().nodes()</font>).

<p>
NetworkX can be used to analyse the (bipartite) graph consisting
of formal objects and formal attributes in a variety of manners. NetworkX also
allows to convert the data into a number of other 
formats, including <a href="#matrix">matrices</a>.

<a name="netwlat">
<h4>NetworkX: Importing concept lattices as graphs</h4>

In order to import a concept lattice as a graph into NetworkX, the 
"dot" file of the lattice <a href="#preprocessing">as produced by FcaStone</a>
can be converted into a csv file of the lattice graph using the
following Python script. The script reads a file sageExample.dot and
outputs a file sageExampleLattice.csv. This script will only work with
dot files produced by FcaStone, not dot files in general. 

<font color=blue><pre>
import re
file = open("sageExample.dot","r")
text = file.readlines()
file.close()

outputfile = open("sageExampleLattice.csv","w")

keyword1 = re.compile(r"\[|\{|\}")
keyword2 = re.compile(r" -> ")

for line in text:
    if not keyword1.search (line):
         outputfile.write(keyword2.sub(",",line))
</pre></font>

<p>
This can be read into NetworkX using<br>
<font color=blue>
G = networkx.read_edgelist("sageExampleLattice.csv",delimiter=",",create_using=DiGraph())
</font>.

<p>
If pygraphviz or pydot are installed, it is also possible to read a 
dot file into NetworkX using read_dot(path). Most likely the dot
file produced by FcaStone might need to be edited before it can be
read in this manner because it contains invisible edges for placing the
labels.

<a name="netwdot">
<h4>NetworkX: Producing gif files of the graphs (via Graphviz)</h4>

Using Sage, graphs can be visualised using <font color="blue">G.show()</font>.
<p>
In order to visualise the graphs using NetworkX (without Sage), one needs to install
further software. If <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">
Graphviz</a> is installed, then the proper interfaces
are established via pygraphviz or pydot. If one does not want 
to also install those tools, there is  a very primitive write_gif()
function that produces gifs using Graphviz without pygraphviz or pydot.
The code is available <a href="http://www.upriss.org.uk/maths/writegif.html">here</a>
and some more information on how to use it is on 
<a href="http://www.upriss.org.uk/maths/ma5.html">this page</a>.
To install write_gif() one can save it as writegif.py into the readwrite directory
in NetworkX and edit the __init__.py file in that directory to import
it.

<a name="matrix">
<h4>Matrices: importing formal contexts as matrices</h4>

There are at least three different ways of representing matrices in
Sage: using the Sage core, using Numpy and using Sympy which all have
different functions and structures. Currently there does not seem to
be an implementation of Relation Algebra or Boolean Matrix Algebra in
Sage therefore not all context operations that are common for FCA
applications are available. But Sage does allow Matrices to be
represented over GF(2) which ensures that they contain only 0s and 1s.
<p>

There are different ways of importing formal contexts:
<p>
a) Convert the context to slf format and delete everything before and
including "[relation]". Then use:

<font color=blue><pre>
import numpy
from sage.all import *
M1 = Matrix(numpy.loadtxt("sageExampleMatrix.txt"))
N1 = M1.change_ring(GF(2))
</pre></font>

or b) import a csv file of a context, convert it to a graph and from
there into a matrix:
<font color=blue><pre>
import networkx
import numpy
from sage.all import *
G = networkx.read_edgelist("sageExample.csv",delimiter=",")
M2 = networkx.to_numpy_matrix(G,['girl','woman','boy','man',\
'female','juvenile','adult','male'])[0:4,4:9]
N2 = Matrix(numpy.array(M2)).change_ring(GF(2))
</pre></font>

The conversion from a graph to a matrix depends on which graph node
corresponds to which matrix row/column. Therefore the to_numpy_matrix()
function needs to know the sequence of the formal objects and
attributes. The Numpy matrix is then reduced to those rows and columns
which form the context (by using [0:4,4:9]) and converted into the Sage
Matrix format. After issuing these statements N1 and N2 are equal.


<p>
In a similar manner the context can be converted into a 
Scipy sparse matrix using to_scipy_sparse_matrix(G).
<p>
The following table shows some of Sage's matrix operations that
could be useful for FCA:
<p>
<table border =1 cellpadding=2>
<tr><td>dual matrix (mirrored along diagonal) <td>transpose(N1) 
<tr><td>apposition of N1 and N2 <td>N1.augment(N2) 
<tr><td>subposition of N1 and N2 <td>N1.stack(N2) 
<tr><td>null matrix of dimension i <td>Matrix(GF(2),i,i,0) 
<tr><td>diagonal matrix of dimension i <td>Matrix(GF(2),i,i,1) 
<tr><td>test for equality <td> N1 == N2 
<tr><td>test for containment<td> N1 < N2 
<tr><td>switching rows i and j <td>N1.swap_rows(i,j) 
<tr><td>switching columns i and j <td>N1.swap_columns(i,j) 
<tr><td>forming a submatrix <td>N1.submatrix(i,j,k,l) 
<tr><td>calculating density <td>N1.density() 
</table>

<a name="poset">
<h4>Using lattice/poset operations</h4>

The code example shows how Sage's poset and lattice operations can be
applied to concept lattices that have been imported as described in
the section <a href="#netwlat">above</a>.

<font color=blue><pre>
import networkx
from sage.all import *
G = networkx.read_edgelist("sageExampleLattice.csv",delimiter=",",create_using=DiGraph())
P = Poset((G.networkx_graph().nodes(),G.networkx_graph().edges()),cover_relations=True)
P.show()
P1 = Poset(G)
P1 == P
P.top()
P.bottom()
P.is_meet_semilattice()
L = LatticePoset(G)
L.is_distributive()

</pre></font>

<h4>Future: How to develop a full FCA/Sage tool</h4>

Challenges/Questions:

<ul>
<li>There are already a number of FCA Python tools 
(search for "Python" on <a href="https://upriss.github.io/fca/fcasoftware.html"> 
this page</a>). Can any of the existing tools be integrated with Sage?
<li>Data structures (classes) for formal contexts and
concept lattices that can be integrated with Sage are needed.
<li>User testing may be required to determine which FCA operations are
most useful for a command-line environment. (Most likely users prefer
GUI components for entering formal contexts, browsing lattices; but
attribute exploration might be a good candidate for Sage.)
<li>FCA context operations could be developed as matrix operations for
Sage's core or for Sage's components Numpy or Sympy.
</ul>

<p>
If anybody is interested, the Sage community might be 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/e87b59fdeb3b647e">willing
to help</a> with respect to how to build Sage components.
