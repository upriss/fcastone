FcaStone (named in analogy to "Rosetta Stone") is a command-line utility that converts between the file formats of commonly-used FCA tools and between FCA formats and other graphics formats. The main purpose of FcaStone is to improve the interoperability between FCA, graph editing and vector graphics software. 

The last version of FcaStone is from 2010. It used to be hosted on SourceForge. 
But it is written in Perl and still works. It does not require any installation apart from copying the Perl file somewhere.
